# pi-podman

Containerized [Pi Coding Agent](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent) powered by Debian Sid and Node.js 26.

A ready-to-use Podman image that bundles the Pi coding agent with essential development tools in an isolated, reproducible environment.

## Script (Recommended)

Use `pi-podman` to manage the container lifecycle:

```bash
./pi-podman
```

The script handles everything automatically:

| State | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Image missing | `podman build` then run |
| No container | `podman run -it` (create + start) |
| Container stopped | `podman start -ai` (resume) |
| Container running | `podman attach` (reconnect) |

It mounts `$PWD` as `/workspace`. To pass API keys or other env vars, edit the script and add `-e` lines to the `podman run` command.

To use it from anywhere:

```bash
sudo ln -s "$(pwd)/pi-podman" /usr/local/bin/pi
```

Then just `pi` to start or resume your session.

## Manual Usage

```bash
podman build -t pi-podman -f Dockerfile.pi .
```

### Manual Run

```bash
podman run -it --name pi-podman \
  -v "$(pwd):/workspace:Z" \
  -v "$HOME/.config/pi.dev:/root/.pi/agent:Z" \
  pi-podman
```

The first volume mount uses `$(pwd)` to bind your current directory as the agent's workspace. Replace `$(pwd)` with the absolute path to any project directory you want the agent to work in. The second volume mount persists the agent's configuration across runs. Ensure the host directory exists before running (Podman would otherwise auto-create it as root-owned):

```bash
mkdir -p "$HOME/.config/pi.dev"
```

By giving the container a fixed name (`--name pi-podman`) and omitting `--rm`, you're building a persistent development environment. The first run creates the container; each subsequent `podman start -ai pi-podman` resumes that same container with everything you've installed still in place — tools, libraries, CLI helpers like `gh`, everything.

Running `podman run --name pi-podman` a second time will fail (name already taken), which is a good guardrail: it forces you to `podman start -ai pi-podman` and pick up where you left off. If you ever want a fresh start, just remove the old container (`podman rm pi-podman`) and run again.

If you prefer a clean, ephemeral container, add `--rm` and drop `--name`:

```bash
podman run --rm -it \
  -v "$(pwd):/workspace:Z" \
  -v "$HOME/.config/pi.dev:/root/.pi/agent:Z" \
  pi-podman
```

> [!WARNING]
> **Always use rootless Podman** — do **not** run with `sudo podman` or the `--privileged` flag.
>
> In rootless mode, Podman maps the container's root user to your host UID via user namespaces, so files created under `/workspace` remain owned by you. Running with `sudo` or `--privileged` bypasses this mapping: the agent runs as real root, and any file it creates on your mounted volumes will be owned by root on the host.

| Component       | Version / Details          |
| --------------- | -------------------------- |
| Base image      | Debian Sid (slim)          |
| Node.js         | 26.5.0                     |

### Included Tools

`bash`, `ca-certificates`, `curl`, `fd-find`, `git`, `gnupg`, `jq`, `libatomic1`, `make`, `nano`, `neovim`, `openssh-client`, `procps`, `ripgrep`, `tree`, `unzip`, `vim`, `wget`, `xz-utils`, `zip`

### Installing Additional Tools

The image is based on Debian Sid, so the agent can install missing development tools or libraries on the fly. Simply ask the agent to run:

```bash
apt-get update && apt-get install -y <package-name>
```
